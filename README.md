<b> Generic Model Toolkit </b> - an abstract class for creating Tensorflow model subclasses, with helper datasets and functions.

Toolkit for creating models and datasets in Tensorflow, allowing for instant training of a model on a dataset with 
compatible features. Just override the Dataset abstract class to implement your dataset with features,
then inherit from the GenericModel class to create a model architecture with a defined input/output interface. Read documentation
for more information.
